Created out of boredom during the summer of my sophomore year,
this website combines two of my favorite things from college:
software engineering and trolling.
</pre>
<pre id="redOrangeText" style="color:#FF5200">
As much as I enjoy physical trolls, such as hiding my friend's
TIE figher in my room for a month, as a major in Electrical
Engineering and Computer Science, I've always wanted to do a
more CS kind of troll, and this website is a compilation of
the many software trolls that I have come up with since.
</pre>
<pre id="orangeText" style="color:orange">
Like any software-related creation, it is always under constant
development, so I encourage you to email me suggestions for
improvements at any time! May the troll be with you!
