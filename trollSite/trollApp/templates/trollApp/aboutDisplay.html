            Created out of boredom during the summer of my sophomore
            year, this website combines two of my favorite things from
            college: software engineering and trolling.

            As much as I enjoy physical trolls, such as hiding my friend's
            TIE figher in my room for a month, as a major in Electrical
            Engineering and Computer Science, I've always wanted to do a
            more CS kind of troll, and this website is a compilation of
            the many software trolls that I have come up with since.
        </pre>
        <pre id="orangeText" style="color:orange">
            Like any software-related creation, it is always under constant
            development, so I encourage you to email me suggestions for
            improvements at any time! May the troll be with you!
