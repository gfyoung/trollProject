Custom submission
- Performance issues (somewhat slow)

- Cross-browser compatibility
  - Requires working version of Python for each OS
  - Can emulate Windows with Wine but no equivalent for Mac
  - Current work around: rely on different servers/OS's to run the code
    but this is not feasible in production due to lack of OS's on Linux server

- Security issues
  - Need cooperation from user for the file to be run
    - Permission to download .exe
    - Make file executable on Linux or OSX

- Give them their code as well in a zip
  - visibility of code to the user?

Design considerations
- Arrangement of components should look "nice" across all browser/screen sizes
