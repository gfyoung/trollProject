pyinstaller -w -F <filename.py>
individual trolls first before packaging together

troll emails
- Kevin and Hotwheels
- Synonyms dictionary to replace known words with longer, less known (and hence
more confusing) words

Suggestions page
- need sender email?

Test setup Window VM ssh
- http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/tr-dojo/set-up-a-free-ssh-server-on-windows-7-with-freesshd/

Provided downloads
- Remove "Test Download" in any official releases
- Will need to refactor migration code, as migrations will eventually include
updates and deletions

Custom submission
- Cross-browser compatiblity
  - Mac pyinstaller might help
  - creationflag not used in OSX or Linux
  - Current work around: rely on different servers (with different OS's)
    to run the code
  - Better work around might be to have as many copies of Python so as to not
    need to require multiple servers and trick pyinstaller into compiling for
    different systems
- Due to security issues, need cooperation from user for the file to be run
(e.g. user needs to okay .exe download OR user needs to make file executable
in Linux and OSX)
- Give them their code as well in a zip (see stackoverflow above)
  - visibility of code to the user?
  - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14568647/create-zip-in-python
- Build file for convertToExe files via py_compile for use in views?
- Concurrency Issues (What happens when there are simultaneous submissions?)
  - Current method is to use the system time to create temp file, but that can
    be bad if there are mulitple submissions at the same time (file overwrite
    is a potential issue)
  - Perhaps better way of naming temp files is needed (e.g. user-provided title)
- Performance issues (somewhat slow)
- What happens if a user provides a library that does not exist in the current
  libraries for any of the servers?

Unittests
- Need to make redirectProb configurable; otherwise, tests will intermittently fail because sometimes
it will render the troll page or actually do a redirect
- Test helper synonym generating functions
- Test trollify email

All TODO's in the code
