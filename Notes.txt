Troll emails
- Troll links?

Custom submission
- Performance issues (somewhat slow)

- Cross-browser compatibility
  - Requires working version of Python for each OS
  - Difficult to emulate different OS' on one server
    - Wine can be used to emulate Windows but it is not well polished
  - Current work around: rely on different servers/OS's to run the code
    but this is not feasible in production due to lack of OS's on Linux server

- Security issues
  - Need cooperation from user for the file to be run
    - Permission to download .exe
    - Make file executable on Linux or OSX

- Give them their code as well in a zip
  - visibility of code to the user?

Admin page
- invalid_setup.html override?
  - May need it later depending on configuration
  - Generated in options.py (where ModelAdmin class is located)
- app_index.html override?
  - May need it later depending on configuration
  - Generated in sites.py (where AdminSite class is located)
- In general, search for templates to override in the templates folders
  located under particular sub-folders of django/contrib
- Better UI
  - Not of high priority given that it is not to be used by the public

Design considerations
- Arrangement of components should look "nice" across all browser/screen sizes
- Text should look "nice" for reading across all browser/screen sizes
- Add some more UI to the simulate game?

Troll games (next release)
- Tetris? (tougher to implement)
- Blackjack? (but how to troll?)

Own Troll Language? (need specifics)
