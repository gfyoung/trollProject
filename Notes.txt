pyinstaller -w -F <filename.py>
individual trolls first before packaging together

troll emails
- Kevin and Hotwheels

Suggestions page
- need sender email?

Custom submission
- Cross-browser compatiblity
  - Mac pyinstaller might help
  - creationflag not used in OSX or Linux
- Give them their code as well in a zip (see stackoverflow above)
  - visibility of code to the user?
  - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14568647/create-zip-in-python
- Build file for convertToExe files via py_compile for use in views?
- Concurrency Issues (What happens when there are simultaneous submissions?)
  - Current method is to use the system time to create temp file, but that can
    be bad if there are mulitple submissions at the same time (file overwrite
    is a potential issue)
  - Perhaps better way of naming temp files is needed (e.g. user-provided title)
- Performance issues (somewhat slow)
- Allow user to upload file as alternative to typing in textarea

All TODO's in the code
