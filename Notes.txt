pyinstaller -w -F <filename.py>
visibility of code to the user?
individual trolls first before packaging together

troll emails (Kevin and Hotwheels)
suggestions page
UI is awful (content comes first!)

create a submit (how to make it cross-browser compatible? Mac pyinstaller might help)
wrap submission executable in try/except Exception, e (print e) block to print error message?
give them their code as well in a zip (see stackoverflow above)
create build file for your convertToExe files via py_compile for use in views?
performance issues (somewhat slow)

All TODO's in the code
