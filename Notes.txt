Troll emails
- Troll links?

Provided downloads
- Remove "Test Download" in any official releases

Custom submission
- Cross-browser compatibility
  - Requires working version of Python for each OS
  - Can emulate Windows with Wine but no equivalent for Mac
  - Current work around: rely on different servers/OS's to run the code
    but this is not feasible due to lack of OS's on Linux server

- Security issues
  - Need cooperation from user for the file to be run
    - Permission to download .exe
    - Make file executable on Linux or OSX

- Give them their code as well in a zip (see stackoverflow above)
  - visibility of code to the user?
  - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14568647/create-zip-in-python

- Concurrency Issues (What happens when there are simultaneous submissions?)
  - Current method is to use the system time to create temp file, but that can
    be bad if there are multiple submissions at the same time (file overwrite
    is a potential issue)
  - Perhaps better way of naming temp files is needed (e.g. user-provided title)

Design considerations
- Arrangement of components should look "nice" across all browser/screen sizes
- Text should look "nice" for reading across all browser/screen sizes
- How to format the sizes of SUBMIT and SELECT input buttons?

- Performance issues (somewhat slow)

All TODO's in the code
