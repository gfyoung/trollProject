pyinstaller -w -F <filename.py>
individual trolls first before packaging together

Troll emails
- Need to unit test
- Kevin and Hotwheels
- Synonyms dictionary to replace known words with longer, less known (and hence
more confusing) words

Suggestions page
- need sender email?

Test setup Window VM ssh
- http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/tr-dojo/set-up-a-free-ssh-server-on-windows-7-with-freesshd/

Provided downloads
- Remove "Test Download" in any official releases
- Will need to refactor migration code, as migrations will eventually include
updates and deletions

Custom submission
- Cross-browser compatibility
  - Mac pyinstaller might help
  - Current work around: rely on different servers/OS's to run the code
  - Better work around: different copies of Python on one machine and
  trick pyinstaller into compiling for different systems

- Security issues
  - Need cooperation from user for the file to be run
    - Permission to download .exe
    - Make file executable on Linux or OSX

- Give them their code as well in a zip (see stackoverflow above)
  - visibility of code to the user?
  - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14568647/create-zip-in-python

- Concurrency Issues (What happens when there are simultaneous submissions?)
  - Current method is to use the system time to create temp file, but that can
    be bad if there are multiple submissions at the same time (file overwrite
    is a potential issue)
  - Perhaps better way of naming temp files is needed (e.g. user-provided title)

- Performance issues (somewhat slow)

- What happens if a user provides a library that does not exist in the current
  libraries for any of the servers?

All TODO's in the code
