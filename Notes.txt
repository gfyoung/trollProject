pyinstaller -w -F <filename.py>
visibility of code to the user?
individual trolls first before packaging together

troll emails (Kevin and Hotwheels)

About page
- Something basic, make more substantial later

Suggestions page
- need sender email?
- email server

UI is awful (content comes first!)
- Rotating trollFace picture
- Devil picture/colors
- Menubar

Custom submission
- Cross-browser compatiblity (Mac pyinstaller might help)
- Wrap submission executable in try/except Exception, e (print e) block to print error message?
- Give them their code as well in a zip (see stackoverflow above)
- Create build file for your convertToExe files via py_compile for use in views?
- Performance issues (somewhat slow)

All TODO's in the code
